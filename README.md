# Lab-Trend-Detection-SandBox
Overview:
-A sandbox project exploring time-series laboratory trend detection using simulated data. This notebook focuses on identifying and visualizing temporal patterns and directional changes in lab-style measurements over time.

-The project is exploratory and educational in nature, inspired by concepts from coursework and the MIT AI in Healthcare program.

Key Focus:
-Preprocessing longitudinal lab time-series data

-Analyzing trends and trajectory behavior

-Visualizing temporal patterns for interpretability

Data:
-Simulated lab data only

-No real patient or clinical datasets used

Files:
-lab_trend_detection.ipynb — Main exploratory notebook

Tools:
-Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

Notes:
-This project is a sandbox prototype intended for learning and experimentation.
Related clinical research work is maintained privately.
